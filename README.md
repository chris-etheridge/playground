# playground

## What is this

A playground for me to learning all things Clojure and ClojureScript. I am working towards making this into a chat web app.

## Development

Open a terminal and type `lein repl` to start a Clojure REPL
(interactive prompt).

In the REPL, type

```clojure
(run)
(browser-repl)
```
