# playground

## What is this

A playground for me to learning all things Clojure and ClojureScript.
This is a collection of test apps that I will use to learn.

## Running

To run, use `lein figwheel` and the build name. Example:

```clj
lein figwheel devcards chat todo
```

Then open up `localhost:3449/BUILD.html`. Example:

``` localhost:3449/chat.html```
